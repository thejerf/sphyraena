* The context package needs a rename. It should go ahead and embed a
  context in there but it shouldn't conflict with the standard one.
* SphyraenaResponseWriter is WTF too long. Needs to be shorter somewhere.
* The startup procedure needs to be simpler. Basically the user just needs
  to be able to specify the various pieces, and they should know how to
  wire themselves together, via interfaces if necessary.
* The router textual serialization really needs to be finished and usable.
* The router clauses need nicer returns than router.Result{}.
