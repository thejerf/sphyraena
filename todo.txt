* The context package needs a rename. It should go ahead and embed a
  context in there but it shouldn't conflict with the standard one.
* The current "session" conflates "identity management", the currently
  non-existent but eventual "some sort of value storage support", and "the
  view of current streams". The latter in particular only works with a
  particular server, values are nominally global, and identity is certainly
  global.
* SphyraenaResponseWriter is WTF too long. Needs to be shorter somewhere.
* The startup procedure needs to be simpler. Basically the user just needs
  to be able to specify the various pieces, and they should know how to
  wire themselves together, via interfaces if necessary.
* The router textual serialization really needs to be finished and usable.
* The router clauses need nicer returns than router.Result{}.
