* The context package needs a rename. It should go ahead and embed a
  context in there but it shouldn't conflict with the standard one.
* The current "session" conflates "identity management", the currently
  non-existent but eventual "some sort of value storage support", and "the
  view of current streams". The latter in particular only works with a
  particular server, values are nominally global, and identity is certainly
  global.

  Streams need to de-integrated with the Session. You can have more than
  one, and sessions are too vague to be guaranteed to be able to fetch
  streams (we don't even know if they are between servers or not).
* SphyraenaResponseWriter is WTF too long. Needs to be shorter somewhere.
  * Also: session.SessionID -> session.ID, several other instances.
  * router.RouteBlock -> router.Block
  * router.AddExactLocation -> method on route block
* The secret and session ID generator should be stuffed in a branch
  somewhere and decommisioned. They complexify setup to save non-zero, but
  rather marginal, amounts of time, and even that under certain circumstances.
* The router textual serialization really needs to be finished and usable.
* The router clauses need nicer returns than router.Result{}.
* To allow session ID rotation, it should be a set where we can use
  multiple secrets for validation, and rotate them in and out through time,
  preferably with an option to automatically refresh the session to the
  latest secret.
