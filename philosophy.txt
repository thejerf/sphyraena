Sphyraena is a web framework designed to make writing secure code the
default. It does its best in an incredibly hostile environment to turn the
web into a default-deny framework.

While anyone can use it, many of its design decisions are based on writing
code in a team, where the team conducts code reviews. The web, being
the massive hack that it is, means that many real applications will have to
do something less than "the most secure thing available on the web", and
the point of Sphyraena is ultimately not to make those things impossible,
but to provide you with an environment in which such decisions are
deliberate, visible, and reviewable.

Understanding the priority of "review" is critical to understanding many
aspects of Sphyraena's design. For instance, the design of the route
mapping is designed from top to bottom to ensure that the entire routing
system can be easily reviewed for security concerns.
